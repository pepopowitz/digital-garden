# Sprouts!

This is my digital garden, where I plant seeds of ideas and let them grow. It's a place for me to explore, learn, and share. (CoPilot wrote that poetic introduction.)

It is based on the template from the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden).
