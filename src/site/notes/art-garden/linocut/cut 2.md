# cut #2: leaves (oak)

## background

For my second cut I wanted to work a little on creating tone/shading, so I was looking for kind of a three-color image (black, white, gray). I also was thinking a lot about negative space. It's the time of year when trails are covered in fallen leaves, and while trail running I've been noticing how a bed of oak leaves has a lot of nice edges that would be fun to carve. I took a photo while on a run, where I hoped to catch a good amount of shadow: 

I love the idea of losing myself in carving every detail of this, but that is not reality, as I just don't know how to create all those different tones. For this carve I initially tried to incorporate _some_ details of the "background" leaves, but I wasn't happy with any of it, so I just stuck with three "foreground" leaves, each with some shading.

## things I learned along the way

- I tried to apply an acrylic wash to the block before carving. The tube of acrylic paint I used was _very old_, and I also think I made it to watery. I'll try again with less water, and a newer tube.
- I initially thought I could mark the printout directly with pencil to avoid having to use tracing paper. I marked the outline of the block on the printout, but trimming the paper to size was more helpful than just an ink outline. Then I discovered that I couldn't see the pencil marks on the printout, so I had to scrap this approach and go with tracing paper.
- It was wayyyyy easier to trace over the printout than over the ipad screen, like I tried in [[art-garden/linocut/cut 1\|cut 1]]. But still kind of difficult. 
- I think next time I'm going to try carbon paper and tracing on the original printout with a colored ball-point pen. 
- The block is not a perfect square! Not off by more than 1/16" in one direction, but it was noticeable after I'd trimmed the papers. 
- After tracing on tracing paper, and rubbing on the block, it was kind of blurry and not great. I went over the lines on the block with a pen, but it was blurry enough that I had to use the original printout as reference for a good amount. (And since it was mirrored, it was confusing at times.)
- I didn't include all the tone details that I did on the ipad. I included the _areas_ that will be shaded, but I didn't copy the shading lines, because it seemed like a ridiculous amount of effort. Instead I plan to make that up on the fly, as I'm carving. Yolo.
