I'm chasing the hype of [Zed](https://zed.dev), and taking it for a spin. 

**Verdict** (Jan 9, 2025): I can't use it until it has built-in git visualization. I find myself opening VS Code just to view my staged/local changes. The speed is great, and especially the fact that it can handle changing branches in very large projects with no noticeable effects, but the lack of a git interface is a deal-breaker for me.

## Likes
- it does seem a lot faster
- I can switch branches in a very large project (with lots of differences between branches) and there is no noticeable lag afterward!

## Dislikes
- plugins/features missing compared to VS code
	- colored theme based on which project I'm working in
	- a command to move a file to the next split??? This surprised me that it doesn't exist but it seems correct. So basically I have to use my mouse to move to the next/previous split and I don't like that.
	- no git view! I apparently use the VS Code git view a lot to see what I've edited. This is the most deal-breaker-y dislike so far.
