	- this video made me HYPED to try it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHPmChLVl0&t=2m50s
	- Other neat tools included: 
		- https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar
			- nice organization of top bar, including organized display of available spaces
		- https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders
			- aside from coloring the active border, not as useful/necessary as sketchybar I don't think
			- [examples](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47)
	- concerned that I'll have to re-learn tiling. I am using Divvy for tiIing and I like it, I only really want the space management features of AeroSpace.
