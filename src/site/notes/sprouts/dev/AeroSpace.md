- this video made me HYPED to try it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHPmChLVl0&t=2m50s
		- Other neat tools included: 
			- https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar
				- nice organization of top bar, including organized display of available spaces
			- https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders
				- aside from coloring the active border, not as useful/necessary as sketchybar I don't think
				- [examples](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47)
- concerned that I'll have to re-learn tiling. I am using Divvy for tiIing and I like it, I only really want the space management features of AeroSpace.
- another video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FoWClVHG5g
	- shows a lot more detail about commands & events
	- also shows default aerospace functionality, without sketchybar/jankyborders on top of it.
	- it seems like aerospace assumes windows should be grouped by application, or at least this video demoes ways to connect them that way. I tend to group windows by theme, and they cross application, and I have multiple edge windows for example in many different groups. There's nothing that prevents me from doing this, but I am interested in automating the creation of workspaces, and can I do that with a different code/edge window in each automated workspace?
