- I don't write nearly as much as I used to.
- A significant reason for this is the bar for entry.
	- Writing long-form blog articles takes too dang long, and a lot of effort.
	- But I have lots of thoughts throughout the day that would be fine as short-form posts.
	- And I like the idea of building drafts of longer-form writing in public.
	- Short-form in the form of social media posts feels dead to me at this point. No engagement, and I change main drivers every 6 months.
- Soooooo I've set up this digital garden, using Obsidian, and the Digital Garden extension to publish it. 

## TODO
- Make sure there is a solid sitemap & RSS feed
- Add a header to link it back to my blog/site
- Add a link to it in my site's header
- Prove in Obsidian that I can easily create content here & link to it from my daily notes
- Get timestamps displaying
- Add a feed somewhere for most recent updates
- Automate posting updates to socials?
