I kind of want to go to art school but I kind of don't want to start my career over. So I'm trying to build my own learning plan...or at least keep track of courses I might want to take.

## "syllabus"

Most of these are from domestika. It has lots of videos but they lean way more practical than theoretical. Like, "here's how _I_ create this specific artwork," not "these are the theories behind why I'm creating this artwork this way." I wish there was more of the latter.
