## takeaways
- collect examples in pinterest to look back to!!!!
- Change settings in figma to use a higher pixel density!
	- This will make for better printed transfers
	- Also I should probably just define some frames that are the correct size for my blocks & paper, so that I don't need to be precious about that
- Use color multiply to include lines from an early sketch in a later version, and just color over them. 
	- Experiment with which colors of original sketch, knowing they're going to end up multiplied with color background.z
