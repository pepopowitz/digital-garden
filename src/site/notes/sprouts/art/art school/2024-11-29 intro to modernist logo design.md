- instructor is the person that runs logo archive (which I follow on threads)
	- his last lesson is very much about hustling to build something like logo archive

## takeaways
- process
	- read a project brief from the client, pull out key facets
		- including formulating some ideas about how to represent those facets
	- keep a small list of those guiding facets along every step of the project
	- dump a gajillion quick sketch ideas into a sketchbook
		- "compounding" - combine two or three different motifs
			- helps guarantee uniqueness
		- you're likely to come up with a ton of derivatives, but that's fine
			- "it's just part of the process, and it's why you come up with so many ideas."
	- choose a few favorites
	- develop those more deeply. Explore variations of them. Tweak them.
	- bring into computer to develop more deeply
	- share with client; iterate. 
	- present them. include many different treatments of the logos, but consistent across the different options.
