- instructor is decent.
- charcoal drawing & gouache painting, collage, and a lot of demonstration of adjustment in photoshop.
- not my favorite course. not bad, but not great.
## takeaways

- make anything black and white if you don't like the levels/color, take it into photoshop to adjust levels and add colors back
- cool colors fade into the background; warm come to the foreground.
- use 33% rule for composition, but also levels (~33% either light or dark) and tone (~33% either warm or cool)
- turn image upside down to check composition
- if needed, there is a bit at the end of the course about exporting images for different purposes (web/magazine/art print)
