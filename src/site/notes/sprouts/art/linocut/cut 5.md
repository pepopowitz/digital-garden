# Cut 5: running poster
## Background
This is actually the print that made me want to get into linocut printing. A Christmas gift for my wife & kids.

### Outcome
Very happy with the carve. Moderately happy with the design-â€”I think I could have done better with the letter work, I kind of gave up in the name of time and just traced a font. Moderately happy with the print, as I eventually got some good solid black, though I again struggled with ink amount and pressure. 
## Learned along the way
- Still struggling with ink amount & pressure, though I think I did get better. Literally zero pressure beyond gravity on the roller seems to work best, though even this oil-based speedball ink seems to get sticky and dry on the inking plate before the third print, and then I get in trouble from overcompensating.
- Once things did get flooded, I was able to clear it by spraying water on the block, and burning a print on crappy paper to suck the ink up. 
- Pure acetone transfer worked much better than the "rejuvenating" nail polish remover I'd previously used. 
	- I still have issues with the paper wrinkling though as I try to rub it while wet with acetone. 
- I improved my jig more. I added a trimmed out layer of newsprint hinged in one direction, to cover everything except the print itself (because I am clumsy at inking). I added the ternes burton pins from the other direction, and attached tabs to a bunch of sheets before inking anything. 
	- In general I think I'd do well to take more time for this kind of preparation instead of trying to jump right into things.
## Next time
- Use a roller on the acetoned paper for transfer, to see if that's better and less susceptible to warping/wrinkling.
	- Also, probably don't go as heavy as I've been going with the acetone. I've been thinking the presence of acetone itself was handling the transfer, but I think I'm missing contact with the plate while the acetone is present.
- Try some extender to see how that affects the ink drying. 
	- Can I mix a water-based extender with an oil-based ink? Gonna find out.
